# Working with Spotify API

To work with the Spotify API, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Create a Spotify Developer Account**:
    - Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).
    - Log in with your Spotify account.
    - Click on "Create an App" and fill in the required details.
    - Once created, you will get a `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.

2. **Set Up Authorization**:
    - Spotify uses OAuth 2.0 for authorization.
    - You need to get an access token to make API requests on behalf of a user.

3. **Authorization Code Flow**:
    - Redirect the user to Spotify's authorization page.
    - Get the authorization code from the callback URL.
    - Exchange the authorization code for an access token.

4. **Making API Requests**:
    - Use the access token to make requests to the Spotify API endpoints.
